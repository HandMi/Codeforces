# Percolation

This repository contains the solution to the first programming assignment of Coursera's "Algorithm 1" course ( See https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php for reference). The task was to write a percolation class, which decides whether a point is full (i.e. connected to the top) and if there there is a percolation cluster (i.e. a cluster which connects top to bottom).
